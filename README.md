##Where in the World Is Waldo?
This started as me trying to learn the Google Maps Javascript API and Google Places API.
Play ANYWHERE in the world by popping in a latitude and longitude up top.

###How It Works:
The Google Places API allows you to search for places nearby the center of the map.
Using that, I place all the extras on all the cafe's, stores, atms, bus stations and train stations.
Waldo, Wenda, Odlaw, Wizard Whitebeard and Woof are placed on five schools in the area.

###Coming soon:
Eventually, I want to tap into the Google Maps Geocoding service and see if I can have the applet search by any location, not just limited to Lat and Long.
